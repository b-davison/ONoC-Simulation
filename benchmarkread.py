#  File name: 	benchmarkread.py
#  Description: Reads in a log file from a benchmark. Assumes the log is for 16 cores 
#				and that source and destination nodes are in 2-d coordinates Creates 
#				an out list with 2-d source and destination coordinates mapped to 
#				1-d. Assumes that any x coordinate 
# 				that is zero is to memory and is ignored. 
#				Mapping is as follows 
#				(x is along the hoziontal and y is along the verticle):
# 				 |0 1  2  3  4  5  6  7
# 				-|---------------------
# 				1|0 1  2  3  4  5  6  7
# 				2|8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
